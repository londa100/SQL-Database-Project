# Yum-Yum Burgers Database Management System

# Overview

As part of my final-year database systems coursework, I designed and implemented a relational database system for Yum-Yum Burgers, a fictional fast-food restaurant chain. The goal was to create an efficient, scalable backend that supports daily operations in a high-volume, customer-focused environment.

This system helps Yum-Yum Burgers deliver fast, friendly, and delicious food to customers every day by streamlining:

- Order processing and fulfillment
- Real-time inventory tracking to avoid stockouts
- Employee scheduling and role management
- Supplier coordination
- Sales analysis and customer preference insights

# Key Features

- Menu Management — Add, update, and categorize menu items (burgers, sides, drinks, combos) with prices, ingredients, and availability status.
- Employee Management — Store employee details, roles (cashier, cook, manager), and work schedules/shifts.
- Supplier & Inventory Tracking — Manage suppliers, purchase orders, and current stock levels with low-stock alerts logic.
- Order Processing — Capture customer orders (dine-in, takeout, delivery), link to menu items, calculate totals, apply discounts, and record payment status.
- Sales & Analytics — Track daily/weekly sales trends, identify top-selling items, and analyze customer preferences to support menu optimization and business decisions.

# Business Value

The database ensures:
- Smooth and rapid order handling during peak hours
- Fair and efficient employee scheduling
- Data-driven insights for improving operations and customer satisfaction

Ultimately, the system supports Yum-Yum Burgers' core mission: serving high-quality, delicious fast food quickly and consistently — keeping customers happy and coming back.
